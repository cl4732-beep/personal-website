This is the beginning. A blank page, a cursor blinking, the quiet hum of something about to take shape.

I built this site as a place to collect my thoughts — essays, notes, observations, and whatever else feels worth writing down. Nothing fancy. Just words, set in good type, on a clean page.

## Why write?

Writing is thinking made visible. It forces clarity. When you try to explain something on paper, you quickly discover whether you actually understand it or were just nodding along.

## What to expect

A mix of things:

- Reflections on training and endurance
- Notes on things I'm learning
- Ideas that need a place to live
