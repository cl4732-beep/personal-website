In *Born Standing Up*, Steve Martin describes a small moment that clarifies why Johnny Carson mattered to comedians.

Martin had a routine that depended on pauses and timing. On The Merv Griffin Show, he tried to deliver it as if it were casual chat. Merv interrupted with the literal, reasonable question.

And the bit died.

That is when Martin draws the contrast:

> "Johnny, on the other hand, was the comedian's friend. He waited; he gave you your timing. He lay back and stepped in like Ali, not to knock you out but to set you up. He struggled with you too and sometimes saved you."

Martin's point is not only about jokes. It is about how a person with power can handle another person's vulnerability in real time. The pause where the comedian might fail. The silence where the room can turn.

He adds a second layer, about character and boundaries:

> "But Johnny was not aloof; he was polite. He did not presume intimate relationships where there were none; he took time, and with time grew trust. He preserved his dignity by maintaining the personality that was appropriate for him."

And a third, about what Carson actually enjoyed:

> "Johnny enjoyed the delights of split-second timing, of watching a comedian squirm and then rescue himself, of the surprises that can arise in the seconds of desperation when the comedian senses that his joke might fall to silence."

Johnny understood the craft. He knew when to wait, when to step in, and when to let the struggle do its work.

Everyone needs a Johnny in their life.
