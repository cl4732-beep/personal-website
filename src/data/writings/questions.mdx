Most people search for answers when they would be better served by searching for questions.

Questions are not merely tools for extracting information. They are lenses through which we interpret ourselves and our relationship to reality. The quality of the question determines the resolution of the world it reveals.

Life does not present itself as a single, stable truth. It unfolds through context. Environment shapes experience. Emotion colors perception. Beliefs and values act as filters. Meaning is not discovered in isolation but reinforced by everything surrounding it. What we notice confirms what we are prepared to see.

Every truth, then, rests on its own scaffolding. It is constructed, not arbitrary, but contingent. Change the structure and the truth that emerges changes with it.

Better questions loosen this scaffolding. They suspend judgment long enough to expose hidden assumptions. They allow us to move between scales, to see the forest without losing the trees, and the trees without forgetting the forest.

Answers close. Questions open.

Ask better questions.
